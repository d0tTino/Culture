# Current LLM Reliability Assessment

This brief report summarizes the current state of LLM-based components in the project as of June 2025. It is based on running the available unit tests and attempting the `walking_vertical_slice` demo.

## Summary of Findings

1. **DSPy Integration**
   - Tests relying on DSPy (`test_action_intent_selector_fallback.py`, `test_rag_context_synthesizer.py`) are skipped because the `dspy` package lacks the `Predict` API in this environment.
   - `test_relationship_updater.py` passes, showing that the failsafe path works when DSPy is unavailable.
2. **Vertical Slice Demo**
   - After installing dependencies from both `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`, `python -m examples.walking_vertical_slice` runs successfully.
   - DSPy is stubbed when unavailable, but the demo functions correctly with ChromaDB and a local Ollama instance.
3. **Monitoring**
   - The project uses the `monitor_llm_call` decorator (see `src/shared/decorator_utils.py`) to log metrics for all functions in `src/infra/llm_client.py`, matching the recommendations in `docs/llm_monitoring_strategies.md`.

## Reliability Implications

- With the stubbed DSPy modules, unit tests confirm that fallback behavior is deterministic, but real optimization or role-aligned generation cannot be evaluated.
- With dependencies installed, the vertical slice provides end-to-end runs using ChromaDB and a local Ollama server. DSPy functionality remains stubbed, so reliability metrics cover integration rather than optimization.

## Next Steps

1. Rerun the vertical slice periodically to obtain logs of summarization and intent selection.
2. Monitor the resulting `LLM_CALL_METRICS` logs to evaluate latency, success rate, and directive adherence.
