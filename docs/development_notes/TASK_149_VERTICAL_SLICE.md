# Task 149 Vertical Slice Summary

This document summarizes the minimal end-to-end pipeline implemented for Task 149. The tests exercise a simple interaction loop:

1. **Agent A proposes an idea.** Influence Points are reduced and Data Units are awarded.
2. **The Knowledge Board stores the idea.** A lightweight in-memory store stands in for ChromaDB during tests and can optionally persist to disk.
3. **Agent B retrieves the idea.** The retrieval updates Agent B's relationship with Agent A.
4. **Full flow validation.** Integration tests confirm the step sequence A â†’ B succeeds.

Run the vertical slice tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/agents/test_propose_idea_flow.py \
       tests/integration/agents/test_retrieve_flow.py \
       tests/integration/agents/test_full_conflict_resolution_flow.py -m integration -q
```
