# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Initial State

- **Total Files:** Approximately 53,000
- **Primary Bloat Sources:**
    - Multiple Python virtual environments (e.g., `test_venv`, `test_venv_clean`): ~48,841 files
    - ChromaDB test directories (e.g., `test_chroma_dbs`, `chroma_benchmark_`): ~3,000 files
    - Benchmark and experiment data: ~500 files
    - Python cache files (`__pycache__`)

## Cleanup Strategy and Execution

A multi-phase approach was used to clean the codebase:

1.  **Analysis & Initial Scripting:**
    *   Identified major bloat contributors.
    *   Developed `check_pruning.py` to locate and analyze test-related directories.

2.  **Automated Cleanup (`enhanced_cleanup.py`):**
    *   Removed redundant virtual environments.
    *   Deleted numerous ChromaDB test directories and other test-generated files.
    *   Cleared Python cache files.

3.  **Archival (`archive_tests.py`):**
    *   Archived the `benchmarks` and `experiments` directories into ZIP files.
    *   Archived the `tests` directory, preserving its structure with only `__init__.py` files to maintain importability.

4.  **Manual PowerShell Cleanup (Simulating `final_cleanup.py` due to Python execution issues):**
    *   Force-removed remaining virtual environments (`test_venv_clean`, `test_venv`).
    *   Compressed and then removed `benchmarks` and `experiments` directories.
    *   Compressed `tests` directory, then removed most files, keeping `__init__.py`.
    *   Deleted all identified static and dynamic ChromaDB test directories (e.g., `chroma_db`, `test_chroma_*`).
    *   Removed `.pytest_cache`.

5.  **Preventive Measures:**
    *   A comprehensive `.gitignore` file was created and updated to exclude virtual environments, test database directories, cache files, and logs.
    *   Guidance was provided in `README_cleanup.md` on best practices for maintaining a clean codebase, including proper test teardown.

## Final State

- **Total Files:** 177
- **Files Removed:** Approximately 1,335 from the state after initial automated cleanup (which had already removed tens of thousands).
- **Outcome:** Successfully reduced the file count to well below the target of 1,000 files.

## Key Directories After Cleanup:

*   `archives`: Contains zipped versions of `benchmarks`, `experiments`, and `tests`.
*   `src`: Main application source code (113 files).
*   `tests`: Minimal structure with `__init__.py` files (4 files).
*   Other essential project files and directories (`docs`, `scripts`, `config`, etc.) with minimal file counts.

This cleanup significantly reduces the codebase size, improves performance, and establishes better practices for future development.
