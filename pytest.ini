# Register test markers for categorization
# Default run (pytest): runs only unit tests (no slow, dspy, or integration)
# Full run (pytest -m "slow or dspy or integration"): runs all slow/integration/DSPy tests
markers =
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, isolated, no external services)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (inter-component, may involve controlled external services or mocks)
    slow: marks tests as particularly slow-running (typically >10-15 seconds, use judgment)
    dspy: marks tests that specifically involve DSPy programs or LLM interactions (even if mocked)
    memory: marks tests primarily focusing on memory systems (e.g., ChromaDB operations, RAG, summarization logic)
    critical_path: marks tests covering essential, core functionality that should always pass quickly
    agent_graph: marks tests involving the BasicAgentGraph and its nodes
    simulation: marks tests involving the main Simulation loop or environment
    critical: marks tests covering the most critical functionalities
    fast: marks tests that are very quick (e.g., smoke tests)
    vector_store: marks tests related to vector store functionality
    hierarchical_memory: marks tests for hierarchical memory systems
    mus: marks tests related to Memory Utility Score (MUS)
    core: marks tests related to core agent functionality
    longevity: marks tests as longevity tests (can be slow)
