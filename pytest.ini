    agent_graph: marks tests involving the BasicAgentGraph and its nodes
    simulation: marks tests involving the main Simulation loop or environment
    critical: marks tests covering the most critical functionalities
    slow: marks tests that are known to be particularly time-consuming or require external services
    fast: marks tests that are very quick (e.g., smoke tests)
    critical_path: marks tests covering essential, core functionality
    vector_store: marks tests related to vector store functionality
    hierarchical_memory: marks tests for hierarchical memory systems
