# Relationship Dynamics Refinement Verification Report

## Implementation Summary

This report documents the refinement of relationship dynamics in the Culture.ai project. The goal was to make relationship score updates more nuanced based on message sentiment and existing relationship scores, and to integrate relationship influence more deeply into agent decision-making processes.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Non-Linear Relationship Update Formula

Implemented a more sophisticated relationship update rule in `AgentState.update_relationship()` that considers both the sentiment of the interaction and the current relationship score:

- **Positive Sentiment Updates:** `change_amount = sentiment_score * (max_relationship_score - current_score) * positive_relationship_learning_rate`
  - Creates diminishing returns as relationship approaches maximum
  - Higher existing relationships see smaller increases from positive interactions

- **Negative Sentiment Updates:** `change_amount = sentiment_score * (current_score - min_relationship_score) * negative_relationship_learning_rate`
  - Creates diminishing returns as relationship approaches minimum
  - Lower existing relationships see smaller decreases from negative interactions

- **Targeted vs. Broadcast Messages:** Added `is_targeted` parameter that applies a multiplier to relationship updates from targeted messages compared to broadcast messages

### 2. Enhanced Relationship-Based Prompting

Updated the `prepare_relationship_prompt_node` function in `basic_agent_graph.py` to provide more nuanced relationship-based prompting:

- Identifies strong positive and negative relationships (above 0.5 or below -0.5)
- Provides specific guidance based on relationship intensity
- Offers nuanced decision-making hints influenced by relationship dynamics
- Constructs detailed prompt modifiers that include:
  - Specific guidance for interacting with most positive/negative relationships
  - Lists of agents the agent generally favors or scrutinizes
  - Decision-making hints influenced by relationship dynamics

### 3. Relationship-Influenced Message Sending

Updated `finalize_message_agent_node` to make message sending decisions influenced by relationships:

- Very negative relationships (below -0.7) may result in:
  - 30% chance to suppress messages entirely
  - Shortened/terser messages when sent
- Very positive relationships (above 0.7) for positive messages:
  - 20% boost to send probability
  - Generally more detailed responses

### 4. Relationship Decay and Memory

- Implemented relationship decay toward neutral over time
- Ensured all agents keep history of relationship scores over simulation steps
- Added proper methods to the AgentState class for managing memories and relationships

## Configuration Parameters

Added configurable parameters to control relationship dynamics:

- `POSITIVE_RELATIONSHIP_LEARNING_RATE = 0.2` - Learning rate for positive sentiment interactions
- `NEGATIVE_RELATIONSHIP_LEARNING_RATE = 0.3` - Learning rate for negative sentiment interactions (slightly higher for more impact)
- `TARGETED_MESSAGE_MULTIPLIER = 2.0` - Multiplier for targeted vs. broadcast message influence
- `RELATIONSHIP_DECAY_RATE = 0.01` - Rate at which relationships decay toward neutral each turn

## Testing and Verification

The refined relationship dynamics system was tested through simulation runs. The system now exhibits more realistic social dynamics:

1. Relationships develop gradually and require consistent positive/negative interactions to reach extremes
2. Very positive/negative relationships actually influence agent behavior
3. Targeted messages have stronger impact on relationships than broadcasts
4. Relationships naturally decay toward neutral over time, requiring active maintenance
5. Agent prompting now includes more detailed relationship-based guidance

## Conclusion

The refined relationship dynamics now create a more realistic social simulation with non-linear relationship development, asymmetric positive/negative interactions, and meaningful influence on agent decision-making. The changes make agent interactions more nuanced and human-like, where relationships must be built gradually and are influenced by communication patterns and message content.
