    The agent decision-making process involves multiple stages: 
    1. Perception of the environment
    2. Memory retrieval using RAG
    3. Thought generation
    4. Action intent selection
    5. Message generation or action execution
    
    Each step is optimized with DSPy-trained LLM programs to ensure coherent and appropriate behavior.
    
    The thought generation process creates an internal reflection based on the agent's role,
    goals, and the current situation.
    
    Action intents are selected from a predefined list of possible actions, with the selection
    guided by the agent's thought process, role-specific behavior patterns, and current goals.
